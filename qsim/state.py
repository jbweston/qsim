"""Quantum state vectors

The quantum state of :math:`n` quantum bits is represented as a 1D array of complex
numbers of length :math:`2^n`; the components of the state vector in the
computational basis.

The computational basis for :math:`n` qubits is ordered by the number represented
by the associated classical bitstring.
